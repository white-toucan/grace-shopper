# NORMS

1. If disagreements between two individuals can't be settled in a timely manner, pull in the full team to discuss/vote. Do not take more than 15 minutes to settle the issue as a full team.
2. BANANA SANDWICH
3. Communicate your frustrations. They will not disappear if you let them fester. Let's talk it out. We're all here to learn.
4. `Gitmaster` is a rotating role that will be responsible for looking over PRs and determining whether they require a second/third set of eyes before a merge.
5. Pairs decide their own norms.
6. Pairing is ticket-dependent. We decide during scrum.
7. After works is OK, but not required. If there is interest, work off a team-prioritized list of ticket items and keep team informed of which ones you pick up.
8. Ticket priorities are decided together as a team.
9. Standup is between 10:30 and 11:00.
10. Use the team slack channel to communicate early and often, anything and everything (stepping away for office hours, coming in late, if you have blockers)!
11. Standardized commit messages: [Semantic Commit Messages](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/dev/git-commit-msg.html)
